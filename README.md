# UK Balance Forecaster
A simple website tool to forecast your balance sheet. Link to website: https://jeffg05.github.io/BalanceForecaster/

## How it works
All that you need to do is input your incomes and expenses on the main page of the website. Once this has been completed, you specify the start and end date for the reporting and build the report. The report will then be generated and the site will automatically redirect you to view your report.

## What is included in the report
The report is designed to give you a holistic overview of your balance sheet and do all the less-intuitive tax calculations for you. The taxes currently included in the report are income tax and national insurance contributions. The report contains the following visualisations:
- Account balance over time
- Top incomes
- Top expenses
- Income by year
- Expense by year
- Tax contribution

## Privacy
Since the data handled by this tool is classed as sensitive information, privacy is a key concern. The data you input will only be stored locally on your browser (in the browser's local storage) and never leaves your device. In the settings page, there is an option to clear all your data if you wish to do so. This will remove all your balance sheet information from your browser. If you prefer to manually delete your data, most browsers should allow you a way of clearing the local storage.
